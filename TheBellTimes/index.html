    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 75px;">COVID-19 is a virus I fear that America is all too familiar with. I remember when I had first heard about the virus on a news story. I came to school the next day and nothing had changed: no precautions, no mask, no worries. In my freshman year physics class, someone joked about the virus with our teacher saying something along the lines of,"They are shutting down school. The zombie apocalypse has begun." We all laughed. Little did we know how serious and deadly Covid would be. Little did we know how long it would affect our lives. This was only the beginning of mine and the whole nation's battle against the life threatening virus.
    </p>

      <p1>In this story, I will be comparing and contrasting trends across the nation in terms of their death rates for Covid-19, their restriction plans, their population in relation to Covid deaths, age ranges and using my own first hand experience of the virus to give a comprehensive view on the multifaceted affect Covid had on the lives of American citizens. The data used in this project was acquired from the Centers for Disease Prevention from 2019-2023.

        <p2>The states in this data set are grouped by different regions which are as follows:</p2>

                However, using the CDC's National Health Statistics, I will also be comparing individual states.

            <p>I want to begin with analyzing Alabama as this is where I am originally from. Alabama is notoriously conservative in how it is governed. On October 25, 2021, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey issued a statement about how the state was against the federal government in vaccine mandates saying,"The federal government's outrageous overreach has simply given us no other option, but to begin taking action, which is why I am issuing this executive order to fight these egregious Covid-19 vaccine mandates."

    This graph above shows that Region 4 had the most Covid related deaths from 2019-2023. However, we must keep in mind the populations of the states we are comparing. Based on the 2020 Government Census, Region 4 has a combined population of 67 million. Here are the population sizes for each region:
    </p>

<p>Region 1: 14.8 million (Northeast)
    Region 2: 40.1 million (New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico)
    Region 3: 30.9 million (Mid-Atlantic)
    <b>Region 4: 67 million (Southern U.S.)
    Region 5: 66.5 million (Midwest)</b>

            <p>Region 5 is most comparable to Region 4 in terms of population. In terms of Covid-19 related deaths, Region 4, which includes conservative states that practiced very little Covid restrictions, had more deaths.

                To compare even further and more accurately, I chose to look at the death rates of Alabama and Oregon who both have populations of 4 million according to the 2020 Government Census. However, both these states had different approaches to handling Covid. According to the CDC, in 2020, Oregon had a death rate of <b>26</b> with 1,434 deaths. On the other hand, Alabama had a death rate of <b>103.6</b> with 6,544. 
                </p>
                
                <p><b>With the same population, Alabama had a death rate 298.46% greater than Oregon.
               </b></p>
               
               <p>To understand, let's analyze their policy decisions regarding Covid. In Alabama, they passed a "Safer at home" order in 2020 which allowed businesses to continue operation under safety guidelines. Non-work gatherings required the six feet apart rule. However, athletic events, restaurants, bars and beaches remained open. In 2021, Alabama amended the order to the new "Safer Apart" order where six feet apart was the only guideline as masks were no longer mandated in the state at this time.
                
                On the other hand, Oregon was much more strict with their guidelines putting a two week freeze on businesses and activities. The state assigned counties risk levels based on the spread of Covid in that county. Oregon had a mask requirement, a recommended 14-day quarantine if traveling from outside the state and gatherings were limited to 10-12 people.
                
                The difference in death rates show that Oregon's commitment to Covid restrictions allowed them to not experience so many lives lost.

        <p>Ida Ruth Fields, a Nurse Manager at the Veterans Affair Medical Center in Birmingham, AL who was 65 in 2020, explains that this group was particularly susceptible to Covid based on old age and many in this age group were unvaccinated against other viruses making their healthcare even further behind. She explains from her perspective as a nurse that Covid was so widespread before guidelines and restrictions were even put into place in Alabama and many in this older age group did not get the communication necessary about the extensive dangers of the virus. She says,"I had to be extremely careful in terms of me going places."
        </p>
            
        <p>On the opposite side, my Covid experience was completely different. I found pictures of myself and friends to show how relaxed restrictions and Covid safety measures were within the state of Alabama. Even though I was young and had access to information about Covid, I wasn't well informed. Looking back on these pictures now, I realize how unsafe me, my school and my state truly were, especially to those who were most susceptible to the virus like this older population of 75-84 year olds.</p>

                        <p>However, in this picture on the right from the same day, you can see that the mask didn't stay on for long. My coach encouraged us to take them off. We would then proceede to play other schools with no mask, lots of physical contact and no social distancing.</p>

    <p>This picture from November 11, 2021 shows crowded stands behind me with no mask or social distancing.</p>

    <p>This is to show firsthand how relaxed the Covid restrictions in Alabama truly were in what most would consider the height of the quickly spreading virus.</p>
   
   
    <p style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 70px; text-align: center;">My experience of Covid shows how important it is to do your own research of something and then decide for yourself how you want to proceed. I listened to those around me and therefore put many in danger through my ignorance  and lack of knowledge about the virus. I hope now with these graphs and stories it can put into perspective how impactful Covid was and how, unfortunately, deadly it was for the entire nation.</p>
