<p>Samantha Bee was 47 years old when she found herself sobbing at the doctor’s office.</p>

<p>The comedian and former prime-time talk show host went in for her annual appointment but burst into tears after her gynecologist asked how she was doing. “I was like, ‘I never sleep. I get my period every eight days, I don’t know what is going on with my body, my job is so hard,’” Bee, now 55, recalled in a phone call.</p>

<p>She had been suffering for over a year, she admitted. Bee, who debuted her limited-run off-Broadway show “How to Survive Menopause” in New York City this October, said she’d been scared she “was losing [her] mind … I was like, ‘something terrible is happening to me.’”</p>

<p>But the doctor offered another explanation. “She was like, ‘Hold the phone!’” Bee said. “‘How old are you? Oh honey, you’re in perimenopause.’”</p>

<p>Perimenopause — the time leading up to menopause — has recently entered pop culture with the ferocity of a hot flash. That’s when hormone fluctuations can trigger heart palpitations and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms, in doctor speak), mood swings, memory lapses, vaginal dryness and more. Yes, women have long been told (however vaguely and inadequately) about menopause, but the turbulent trip to get there? Nobody really prepared them for that shock. And now they’re looking for answers, anywhere they can get them. Google trends data shows that searches for “perimenopause” started rising in late 2022 and jumped up again in early 2024, with no sign of slowing down.</p>

<p>A-listers are literally shouting about it: In May, Halle Berry spoke on Capitol Hill, the dome of the capitol building framing her from behind. “I’m in MENOPAUSE, okay?” she announced with guttural, pathbreaking pride, in support of a $275 million federal pledge for menopause research and education. “Our doctors can’t even say the word to us, let alone walk us through the journey.” Earlier in the year, Berry also talked about a herpes misdiagnosis she had received a few years ago during perimenopause, saying her doctor had no understanding of the condition.</p>

<p>Other celebrities preaching from the perimenopause pulpit include Drew Barrymore, 49, and Gwyneth Paltrow, 52, who has been noodling on the once-shrouded life transition with the buy-in of her well-heeled Goop-ies. Two high-profile Naomis have shared details about their symptoms: Naomi Campbell, 54, fanned herself when a hot flash hit on camera in the Apple TV docuseries “The Super Models,” while Naomi Watts, 56, has launched Stripes Beauty, a product line aimed at midlife customers.</p>

<p>The dawn of the perimenopausal woman has arrived, and with it, a flood of creativity. In May, Miranda July published her best-selling novel “All Fours,” in which a 45-year-old “semi-famous artist” finds herself on the edge of a hormonal cliff and jumps, leaving the comfortable shores of domestic life — the New York Times called it “the first great perimenopause novel.” “The Substance,” starring Demi Moore, turns a 50-year-old woman’s quest for eternal youth into a gruesome, phantasmagoric satire that has been interpreted as a metaphor for the “disorienting emotional carnage of menopause.” And who could forget a 2019 episode of “Fleabag,” in which Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s train-wreck, 33-year-old character encounters an older woman, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, who monologues on the pleasures and pitfalls of the path to menopause?</p>

<p>Bee, who will release the Audible version of her show in March, couldn’t be happier that people are finally talking about it. “It’s reverse puberty!” Bee said emphatically. “Puberty was really really hard, okay? But when we were in puberty we were younger and we didn’t have any responsibilities, we didn’t have children ourselves, we didn’t have jobs, we didn’t have mortgages to pay.”</p>
